- feat: add absorb buff from Refracting Aggression Module  
    Add the buff for the absorption shield that procs when you taunt with  
    the Refracting Aggression Module tanking trinket.  
- fix: properly account for Vivacious Vivification for monk  
    The Vivacious Vivification monk class talent makes the next Vivify  
    instant and reduces its cost by 75%. Properly remove the buff when  
    Vivify is cast and add functions for "cast" and "spend" to account for  
    the buff.  
- feat: allow for textures in the caption string  
    Allow for textures in the caption string if the texture ID is enclosed  
    in square brackets, e.g., [461115] will get replaced by the texture for  
    Rapid Fire in the caption string.  
- feat: extract a caption for an action from its comment  
    In the APL profile, when pairing up a comment as the description for the  
    action in the subsequent line, if the comment has the format  
      <Caption> :: <Description>  
    then `<Caption>` is used as the caption for the action, and  
    `<Description>` is used as the description for the action. Otherwise the  
    comment is used unmodified as the description for the action.  
- feat: support multi-line comments in APLs  
    In an APL profile, if a comment line is followed immediately by another  
    comment line, then assume that they are part of the same comment and  
    simply concatentate them together as the subsequent action's  
    description.  
- feat: support a "caption" modifier in the action syntax  
    Support a `caption=...` key-value modifier in the action syntax that  
    works like the `description=...` modifier and allows for annotating an  
    action with a caption.
